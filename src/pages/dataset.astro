Summary:
In the rapidly evolving landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring robust safety measures is of paramount importance. To address this critical need, we propose SALAD-Bench, a safety benchmark specifically designed for evaluating LLMs, attack methods, and defense strategies. 
Distinguished by its extensive scope, SALAD-Bench surpasses conventional benchmarks with its large scale, rich diversity, intricate three-level taxonomy, and versatile functionalities. SALAD-Bench features a meticulously curated array of questions, ranging from standard queries to complex ones enriched with attack and defense modifications, as well as multiple-choice formats. 
To effectively manage the inherent complexity, we introduce an innovative evaluator, the LLM-based MD-Judge, for QA pairs, with a particular focus on attack-enhanced queries, ensuring a seamless and reliable evaluation process. These components extend SALAD-Bench beyond standard LLM safety evaluation to encompass both LLM attack and defense methods evaluation, ensuring its joint-purpose utility. Our extensive experiments illuminate the resilience of LLMs against emerging threats and the efficacy of contemporary defense tactics.


1.     Compact Taxonomy with Hierarchical Levels
A large-scale LLM safety evaluation with hierarchical taxonomy, including 6 domain-level categories, 16 task-level categories, and 65 detailed classes.

2.     Enhanced Difficulty and Complexity
We propose the enhancement procedure to enhance the difficulty and complexity, including attack-enhanced subset, defense-enhanced subset, and multiple-choice questions subset.

3.     Reliable and Seamless Evaluator
For QA pairs, we propose the MD-Judge, a fine-tuned LLM designed to assess question-answer pairs. And for MCQs, we propose the MCQ-Judge, which employs in-context learning and regex parsing to identify unsafe choices from the options provided.

4.     Joint-Purpose Utility
Comprehensive evaluation for LLMs, attacking methods and defense methods.
